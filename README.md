## GoLangTest

Go programs that cover fundamental concepts of the language (of course not all).

I mostly followed the [Go Tour](https://go.dev/tour/welcome/1) and you'll notice a lot of the programs were taken from there, but I have also been skimming [The Go Programming Language](https://g.co/kgs/oXzfAog).
